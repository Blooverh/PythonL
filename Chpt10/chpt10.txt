Keyword "with"  closes the file once access to it is no longer needed, with keyword does not need to be used always
We called opne() method to open file
we can close it by diong close(), however if there is a bug that prevents the closing
method from executing the file may never close

Improperly closed files may cause data to be lost, deprecated or corrupted

rstrip() method removes any whitespace characters from right sid of a string

FILE PATHS
    >> if file to be read is not in the same directory as the py file we need to explicitly tell the directory where those files are.
    If our code is inside a folder called python_work and inside this folder there is another folder called text_files
    if we want to open a file from there we would need to tell which directory to do
    example:
   with open(text_files\\text.txt) 

NOTE: windows systems use backslash (\\) instead of forwardslash (/) when displaying file paths, but we can still use forwardslashs in the code

We can also give the absolute path of a file in case that file is at a completely different directory from the py file

READING LINE BY LINE 
    >> We can use a for loop to iterate through each line fome the file once at a time
Example: filename='pi_digits.txt'
        with open(filename) as file_object:
            for line in file_object:
                print(line)
