#Working with lists

magicians=["Diogo", "Rohana", "Hugo"]
for i in magicians: #i is the variable  associated with each value in the list
    print(i) # prints the value in list where i is associated to the elements in the list

for i in magicians:
    print(f"{i.title()}, that was a great trick! ")

#Avoiding identation Errors
##for i in magicians:
##print(i) -> this does not have block identation
##  print(i) -> indented block (correct way to write this)
############################

for i in magicians: print(i) ## we can also indent the block like this

#example of unecessary identation
message= "hello world"
print(message)# wrong identation will result in error

###LIST COMPREHENSION
>> Allows to generate a list in a shorter way (1 line of code)
>> Combines the for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically appends each new element

for i in range(2,21,2) displays even numbers because of the first 2 given which is the first number
last 2 (x,y,2) just helps interpret that we are selecting specific numbers
for i in range(1,21,2) displays odd numbers because of the 3 given which is the first number

for i in range(3,30,3): displays all number multiple of 3 from 3 to 30

TUPLES:
-> Tuples are used to create lists that are not modifieable, meaning once we instaciate it
we cannot modify the objects in the tuple (immutable)
Immutable list = tuple
mutable list = list

Defining a tuple:
>> just like a list but we use parenthesis instead of square brackets
example: dimensions= (200, 50)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])
