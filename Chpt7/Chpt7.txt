USER INPUT AND WHILE LOOPS

input() fuction pauses your program and waits for the  user to enter some text
Once python receives the user's input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with

The input() function takes one argument: the prompt, or instructions, that we want to display to the user so they know what to do

Writing clear prompts

EAch time we use the input() function, we should include a clear easy to follow prompt that tells the user exactly
what kind of information to put.

USING A FLAG
-> a variable, called flag acts as a signal to the program
>> We can write out programs so they run while the flag is set to TRUE and stop running when several events set the value of the flag to false
>> The while statement then only has to worry whether or not the flag is set to true or false

USING break TO EXIT A LOOP
>> To exit a loop immediately without running any remaining code in the loop, regardless of the results of any conditional test, use the break statement
>> break statement directs the flow of the program, we can use it to control which lined of code are executed and which aren't, so the program only executes code
that you want it to, when you want it to.
>> A loop that starts with while true will run forever unless it reaches a break statement

NOTE:we can use break statment in any type of loop

USING continue IN A LOOP
>> We can use the continue statement to return to the beginning of the loop based on the result of a conditional test.
