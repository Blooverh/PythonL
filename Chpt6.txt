Dictionaires
>> collection of key value pairs
>> each key is connected to a value and we can use a key to access the value associated with that key
>> A key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary

-> Key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other.
When we provide a key, python returns the value associated with that key

Every key is connected to its value by a colon ":" and individual key value pairs are separated by commas

Using get() method to access values 
#get methods used to set a dafault value that will be returned if the requested key does not exist
#syntax: dict.get(key, default=None)

Looping through all key-value pairs
#syntax: for key, value in dict.items():

SET -> set() is a collection in which each item must be unique
# syntax: set = {'item1', 'item2', 'item3'}
# syntax: set = set(['item1', 'item2', 'item3'])

# When wrapping a set() around a list that contains duplicate items. 
# Python identifies the unique items in the list and builds a set from those items 

# Building a set 
# languages = {"python", "java", "JS"} etc....

NOTE: DO NOT MISTAKE A DICTIONARY WITH A SET 
# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
# A set is a collection of values.

# A set cannot have duplicate items.
# A dictionary can have duplicate values, but each key must be unique.

# A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma or by using the built-in function set().
# A dictionary is created by placing a sequence of elements within curly braces {}.

## NESTING DICTIONARY
-> Sometimes we will want to store multiple Dictionaires in a list of items
as a value in a dictionary. This called is NESTING
>> We can nest dictionaries inside a list or a list of items inside a dictionary
Or even a dictionary inside a dictionary

Note: It is common to store a number of dictionaries ina list when each dictionary 
contains many kinds of information about 1 object.

EXAMPLE: We might wanna create a dictionary for each user on a website and 
store each dictionary in a list called users 
>> Each dictionary would contain the users username, first name, last name, and location
>> We could loop through the list and print out all the information we have stored about each user

-------------------------
A LIST IN A DICTIONARY
Rather than putting a dictionary inside a list, it is sometimes useful to put a list inside a dictionary
EXAMPLE: Consider how we might describe a pizza that someone is ordering
>> With a dictionary, a list of toppings could be can be just one aspect of the pizza we are describing

In the following example, two kinds of information are stored for each 
pizza: a type of crust and a list of toppings. The list of toppings is a value 
associated with the key 'toppings'. To use the items in the list, we give the 
name of the dictionary and the key 'toppings', as we would any value in the 
dictionary. Instead of returning a single value, we get a list of toppings:
