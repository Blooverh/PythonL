USER INPUT AND WHILE LOOPS

input() fuction pauses your program and waits for the  user to enter some text
Once python receives the user's input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with

The input() function takes one argument: the prompt, or instructions, that we want to display to the user so they know what to do

Writing clear prompts

EAch time we use the input() function, we should include a clear easy to follow prompt that tells the user exactly
what kind of information to put.
