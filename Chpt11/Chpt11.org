* TESTING IN PYTHON

**
>> When we write a function or class, we can also write tests for that code.
>> Testing provrd that the code works as it is supposed to do
**

* Testing a function 
    ** UNIT tests and Test Cases 
    -> module *unittest* from python library provides tools for testing the code 
        ** A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a function's behavior is correct
        ** A test case is a collection of unit tests that together prove a function behaves the way it is suppose to.
    -> A good test case considers alll posiible kinds of input a function should receive and includes tests to represent each situation

    ** Passing a test 
        -> the syntax for setting up a test case takes some getting used to, but once we've set up the test case 
            its straight forward to add more unit tests for your functions.
        * TODO a test case for a function, import unittest module and the function we want to test
        * Then create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase, and writes a series of methods to test different aspects of the functions behavior

    ** Failing a test

    ** Testing a class 
    -> Similar to testing functions but, we test multiple functions inside of a class

    ** The setUp() method
        * allows user to creat these objects once and then use them in each of the test methods
        * any objects created in setUp() method are ran first and are available for each test method written

* NOTE:
    * When test case is running, python prints one character for each unit test as it is completed
    >> Passing test prints a dot "."
    >> A test that results in error prints an 'E' 
    >> A test that results in a failed assertion prints an 'F'
